Ok so I cooked up a little script I wouldnt use this all the time for starting your server its more for when you are in the weeds and cant figure something out ..be sure to change the home directory in the script and if you are using gauth modify it to look in the right folders .. if you are running a server this point you know how this works . Youl get your regular logs still in logs but look in starting for advanced logs done with strace for every process.
